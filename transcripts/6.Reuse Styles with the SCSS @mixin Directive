Reuse Styles with the SCSS @mixin Directive

Copy/pasting the same code is redundant and updating copy/pasted code slows development velocity. Mixins are reusable chunks of code that are included, similar to calling a function, instead of copy/pasted.

Mixins have some nice features:
- Arguments just like functions.
- Arguments can have default values and optional values.
- Named arguments allow us to use optional and default arguments when the mixin is included.
- Variable arguments allow us to have a dynamic number of arguments when the mixin is included.
- The @content directive allow us to add additional styles when the mixin is included.

In this lesson we learn how to DRY up the code with the SCSS @mixin directive and make copy/paste a thing of the past.
